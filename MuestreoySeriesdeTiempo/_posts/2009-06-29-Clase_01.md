Introducción
------------

Una serie de tiempo es una secuencia de observaciones registradas y
ordenadas de forma periódica, en intervalos de tiempo igualmente
espaciados, tales como, días, meses, semestres, años, entre otros. Estas
observaciones son caracterizadas por una variable aleatoria `$Y_t$`, la
cual depende del tiempo `$t=1,2,\ldots,N$`, y donde el objetivo es
modelar el comportamiento de `$Y_t$` contra `$t$`, siendo `$N$` el
número total de observaciones que se tenga en la serie de tiempo.

Un ejemplo de ésto, se presenta a continuación donde se muestra el
`$PIB$` per capita de Colombia (% anual), para un intervalo de tiempo
anual que va desde 1961 hasta 2017

El estudio de la series de tiempo requiere de procedimientos
estadísticos diferentes a los análisis empleados tradicionalmente,
debido a la dependencia o correlación existente entre los diferentes
puntos observados en el tiempo, la cual no permite suponer que el
conjunto de datos sea independiente e idénticamente distribuido, y en
consecuencia, se hace necesario el empleo de modelos estadísticos que
permitan explicar el comportamiento de variables aleatorias que dependan
del tiempo, para así poder realizar inferencia sobre éstas.

Entre los principales objetivos del análisis de series de tiempo, se
destaca el comprender, describir e identificar patrones en el
comportamiento de las series, evidenciar el efecto de acciones o
decisiones pasadas
(intervenciones)<!-- conocidas como intervenciones hechas sobre la serie. Estas intervenciones pueden tener un efecto moment´aneo o bien un efecto permanente que modifica la estructura de la serie de tiempo intervenida. -->,
realizar pronósticos que contribuyan al proceso de toma de decisiones,
entre otros.

Clases de pronóstico
--------------------

Un pronóstico es una predicción de algún evento futuros, a partir de los
datos pasados que se conocen sobre el suceso específico. Éstos se
emplean para la toma de decisiones, dependiendo de la ventana temporal
que se desee utilizar. Montgomery, Jennings, and Kulahci
([2015](#ref-Montgomery2015), p. 2) señalan que los pronósticos puede
ser clasificados en tres horizontes de tiempo

-   **Corto plazo**: son aquellos que buscan predecir eventos futuros en
    un horizonte de tiempo pequeño, es decir, días, semanas o meses, y
    son empleados generalmente para diseñar estrategias o tomar
    decisiones inmedianta.
-   **Mediano plazo**: son predicciones que se realizan en un horizonte
    de tiempo un poco más amplio, el cual abarca estimaciones entre 1 y
    2 años en el futuro, y se utiliza en general para diseñar
    presupuestos o procesos de producción y planeación de variables
    operativas.
-   **Largo plazo**: son aquellos pronosticos que se extienen a
    horizontes de tiempo mucho más grandes, puesto que éstos pueden
    extenderse a muchos años en el futuro, y se emplean en procesos de
    planificación, programación y proyección de proyectos.

Métodos de pronóstico
---------------------

Una vez se selecciona el horizonte de tiempo, otro factor importante de
los pronósticos es el método de pronóstico que se va a emplear. Según lo
planteado por Chase, Jacobs, and Aquilano ([2009](#ref-Chase2009), pp.
469–470), los pronósticos pueden ser clasificados en cuatro tipos
diferentes, los cuales se definen como técnicas cualitativas, análisis
de series de tiempo, relaciones causales o econométricas y modelos de
simulación.

### Técnicas cualitativas

Los pronósticos cualitativos son basados en opiniones subjetivas, en
donde, la información empleada para realizar el pronóstico, se obtiene
mediante el juicio de un grupo de expertos en el tema, con amplia
experiencia en el área de interés, el cual entrega valores o rango de
valores sobre el comportamiento futuro de la variable de estudio.
Usualmente este método se emplea cuando la información que se tiene de
la variable de interés, es escasa, no puede ser cuantificada o es poco
confiable.

Entre las técnicas empleadas para realizar pronósticos subjetivos se
destacan

-   Técnicas acumulativas
    <!-- Deriva un pronóstico a través de la compilación de las entradas de aquellos que se encuentran al final de la jerarquía y que tratan con lo que se pronostica. Por ejemplo, un pronóstico general de las ventas se puede derivar combinando
    las entradas de cada uno de los vendedores que están más cerca de su territorio. -->
-   Investigación de mercados
    <!-- Se establece para recopilar datos de varias formas (encuestas, entrevistas, etc.) con el fin de comprobar hipótesis acerca del mercado. Por lo general, se usa para pronosticar ventas a largo plazo y de nuevos productos -->
-   Grupos de consenso
    <!-- Intercambio libre en las juntas. La idea es que la discusión en grupo produzca mejores pronósticos que cualquier individuo. Los participantes pueden ser ejecutivos, vendedores o clientes. -->
-   Analogía histórica
    <!-- Relaciona lo pronosticado con un artículo similar. Es importante al planear nuevos productos en los que las proyecciones se pueden derivar mediante el uso del historial de un producto similar. -->
-   Método Delphi
    <!-- Un grupo de expertos responde un cuestionario. Un moderador recopila los resultados y formula un cuestionario nuevo que se presenta al grupo. Por lo tanto, existe un proceso de aprendizaje para el grupo mientras recibe información nueva y no existe ninguna influencia por la presión del grupo o individuos dominantes. -->
